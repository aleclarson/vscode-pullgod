# Agent Instructions

- Maintain the `CHANGELOG.md` file as changes are made.
  - Ensure the version heading reflects the next logical version number (e.g., `## [1.7.2]`), rather than using "Unreleased".
  - Do not add changes to a version that already has a release date (e.g., `## [1.7.1] - 2026-02-22`).
  - When adding a new version heading, do not include a release date.
- Keep the `README.md` file up-to-date after any user-facing changes (new commands, features, settings, etc.).
- A GitHub workflow enforces that `CHANGELOG.md` is modified in every Pull Request.
