# Agent Instructions

- Maintain the `CHANGELOG.md` file as changes are made. When adding to the changelog, ensure the version heading reflects an appropriate version number (e.g., the next logical version), rather than using "Unreleased".
- Keep the `README.md` file up-to-date after any user-facing changes (new commands, features, settings, etc.).
- A GitHub workflow enforces that `CHANGELOG.md` is modified in every Pull Request.
